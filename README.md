Sublime Text color scheme for Coda 2
====================================

an updated monokai .sss color scheme, based off of [Remi Corson's](https://www.remicorson.com/a-sublime-text-like-coda-2-color-scheme) sublime theme IIRC. It highlights with a bit more granularity and is a little closer to what sublimetext did in 2013.

copy the .sss file into the following directory:

~/Library/Application Support/Coda 2/Styles
